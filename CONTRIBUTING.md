Contributing
============

Thanks for your interest in our project. Contributions are always welcome!

We are committed to fostering a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free
environment. Be kind!

If you have questions, ideas or want to report a bug, feel free to [open an
issue]. Or go ahead and [open a pull request] to contribute code. In order to
reduce the burden on our maintainers, please make sure that your code follows
our style guidelines outlined below.

Developing
----------

We recommend that you [develop inside of a virtual
environment](README.md#installation). After you have set it up, simply run the
unit tests to verify that everything is set up correctly:

```sh
pytest
```

We additionally recommend that you set up your editor / IDE as follows.

- Indent with 4 spaces per level of indentation

- Maximum line length of 79 (add a ruler / thin line / highlighting / ...)

- *If you use Visual Studio Code*: Consider using a platform which supports
  third-party language servers more easily, and continue with the next point.

  Otherwise, set up the editor to run `ruff` and `mypy` when saving. To enable
  automatic import sorting with `isort`, add the following to your
  `settings.json`:

  ```json
  "[python]": {
      "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
          "source.organizeImports": true
      }
  }
  ```

  Note that the Pylance language server is not recommended, as it occasionally
  causes false-positive errors for perfectly valid code.

- *If you do not use VSC*: Set up your editor to use the [python-lsp-server]
  and [ruff], and make sure that the relevant pylsp plugins are installed.

  You can install everything that's needed into the virtualenv with pip:

  ```sh
  pip install "python-lsp-server" pyls-isort pylsp-mypy ruff
  ```

  This will provide as-you-type linting as well as automatic formatting on
  save. Language server clients are available for a wide range of editors, from
  Vim/Emacs to PyCharm/IDEA.

Quality controls
----------------

We use the [pre-commit] framework to perform some basic code checks at commit
time. Before you commit your changes, make sure it is installed and set up, as
described in the [installation instructions](README.md#installation):

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Commit message format
---------------------

Within the project core group we agreed on using [Conventional
Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary). Compliance
checking is automated via pre-commit.

Code style
----------

We base our code style on a modified version of the [Google style guide for
Python code]. The key differences are:

- **Docstrings**: The [Numpy style guide] applies here.

  When writing docstrings for functions, use the imperative style, as per
  [PEP-257]. For example, write "Do X and Y" instead of "Does X and Y".

- **Overridden methods**: If the documentation did not change from the base
  class (i.e. the base class' method's docstring still applies without
  modification), do not add a short docstring รก la "See base class". This lets
  automated tools pick up the full base class docstring instead, and is
  therefore more useful in IDEs etc.

- **Linting**: Use [ruff] for static code analysis, and [mypy] for static type
  checking.

- **Formatting**: Use [ruff] as code auto-formatter. The maximum line length is
  79, as per [PEP-8]. This setting should be automatically picked up from the
  `pyproject.toml` file. The reason for the shorter line length is that it
  avoids wrapping and overflows in side-by-side split views (e.g. diffs) if
  there's also information displayed to the side of it (e.g. a tree view of the
  modified files).

  Be aware of the different line length of 72 for docstrings. We currently do
  not have a satisfactory solution to automatically apply or enforce this.

  Note that, while you're encouraged to do so in general, it is not a hard
  requirement to break up long strings into smaller parts. Additionally, never
  break up strings that are presented to the user in e.g. log messages, as that
  makes it significantly harder to grep for them.

  Use [isort] for automatic sorting of imports. Its settings should
  automatically be picked up from the `pyproject.toml` file as well.

- **Typing**: We do not make an exception for `typing` imports. Instead of
  writing `from typing import SomeName`, use `import typing as t` and access
  typing related classes like `t.TypedDict`.

  Use the new syntax and classes for typing introduced with Python 3.10.

  - Instead of `t.Tuple`, `t.List` etc. use the builtin classes `tuple`, `list`
    etc.
  - For classes that are not builtin (e.g. `Iterable`), `import collections.abc
    as cabc` and then use them like `cabc.Iterable`.
  - Use [PEP-604]-style unions, e.g. `int | float` instead of `t.Union[int,
    float]`.
  - Use `... | None` (with `None` always as the last union member) instead of
    `t.Optional[...]` and always explicitly annotate where `None` is possible.

- **Python style rules**: The auto-formatter wins.

- When working with `dict`s, consider using `t.TypedDict` instead of a more
  generic `dict[str, float|int|str]`-like annotation where possible, as the
  latter is much less precise (often requiring additional `assert`s or
  `isinstance` checks to pass) and can grow unwieldy very quickly.

- Prefer `t.NamedTuple` over `collections.namedtuple`, because the former uses
  a more convenient `class ...:` syntax and also supports type annotations.
