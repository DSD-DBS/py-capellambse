Contributing
============

Thanks for your interest in our project. Contributions are always welcome!

We are committed to fostering a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free
environment. Be kind!

If you have questions, ideas or want to report a bug, feel free to `open an
issue`__. Or go ahead and `open a pull request`__ to contribute code. In order
to reduce the burden on our maintainers, please make sure that your code
follows our style guidelines outlined below.

Developing
----------

We recommend that you `develop inside of a virtual environment`__. After you
have set it up, simply run the unit tests to verify that everything is set up
correctly:

__ README.rst#installation

.. code::

    pytest

We additionally recommend that you set up your editor / IDE as follows.

- Indent with 4 spaces per level of indentation

- Maximum line length of 79 (add a ruler / thin line / highlighting / ...)

- *If you use Visual Studio Code*: Consider using a platform which supports
  third-party language servers more easily, and continue with the next point.

  Otherwise, set up the editor to run ``black``, ``pylint`` and ``mypy`` when
  saving. To enable automatic import sorting with ``isort``, add the following
  to your ``settings.json``:

  .. code:: json

      "[python]": {
          "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
              "source.organizeImports": true
          }
      }

  Note that the Pylance language server is not recommended, as it occasionally
  causes false-positive errors for perfectly valid code.

- *If you do not use VSC*: Set up your editor to use the python-lsp-server__,
  and make sure that the relevant plugins are installed. You can install
  everything that's needed into the virtualenv with pip:

  __ https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server

  .. code::

      pip install "python-lsp-server[pylint]" python-lsp-black pyls-isort pylsp-mypy

  This will provide as-you-type linting as well as automatic formatting on
  save. Language server clients are available for a wide range of editors, from
  Vim/Emacs to PyCharm/IDEA.

Code style
----------

We base our code style on a modified version of the `Google style guide for
Python code`__. The key differences are:

__ https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html

- **Docstrings**: The `Numpy style guide`__ applies here.

  __ https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard

  When writing docstrings for functions, use the imperative style, as per
  `PEP-257`_. For example, write "Do X and Y" instead of "Does X and Y".

- **Overridden methods**: If the documentation did not change from the base
  class (i.e. the base class' method's docstring still applies without
  modification), do not add a short docstring รก la "See base class". This lets
  automated tools pick up the full base class docstring instead, and is
  therefore more useful in IDEs etc.

- **Linting**: Use pylint__ for static code analysis, and mypy__ for static
  type checking.

  __ https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint
  __ https://github.com/python/mypy

- **Formatting**: Use black__ as code auto-formatter. The maximum line length
  is 79, as per PEP-8__. This setting should be automatically picked up from
  the ``pyproject.toml`` file. The reason for the shorter line length is that
  it avoids wrapping and overflows in side-by-side split views (e.g. diffs) if
  there's also information displayed to the side of it (e.g. a tree view of the
  modified files).

  __ https://github.com/psf/black
  __ https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

  Be aware of the different line length of 72 for docstrings. We currently do
  not have a satisfactory solution to automatically apply or enforce this.

  Note that, while you're encouraged to do so in general, it is not a hard
  requirement to break up long strings into smaller parts. Additionally, never
  break up strings that are presented to the user in e.g. log messages, as that
  makes it significantly harder to grep for them.

  Use isort__ for automatic sorting of imports. Its settings should
  automatically be picked up from the ``pyproject.toml`` file as well.

  __ https://github.com/PyCQA/isort

- **Typing**: We do not make an exception for ``typing`` imports. Instead of
  writing ``from typing import SomeName``, use ``import typing as t`` and
  access typing related classes like ``t.TypedDict``.

  Use the new syntax and classes for typing introduced with Python 3.10 and
  available using ``from __future__ import annotations`` since Python 3.8.

  Be aware however that this only works in the context of annotations; the code
  still needs to run on Python 3.9! This means that in some (rare) cases, you
  *must* use the old-style type hints.

  - Instead of ``t.Tuple``, ``t.List`` etc. use the builtin classes ``tuple``,
    ``list`` etc.
  - For classes that are not builtin (e.g. ``Iterable``), ``import
    collections.abc as cabc`` and then use them like ``cabc.Iterable``.
  - Use PEP-604__-style unions, e.g. ``int | float`` instead of ``t.Union[int,
    float]``.
  - Use ``... | None`` (with ``None`` always as the last union member) instead
    of ``t.Optional[...]`` and always explicitly annotate where ``None`` is
    possible.

  __ https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0604/

- **Python style rules**: For conflicting parts, the `Black code style`__ wins.
  If you have set up black correctly, you don't need to worry about this though
  :)

  __ https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html

- When working with ``dict``\ s, consider using ``t.TypedDict`` instead of a
  more generic ``dict[str, float|int|str]``-like annotation where possible, as
  the latter is much less precise (often requiring additional ``assert``\ s or
  ``isinstance`` checks to pass) and can grow unwieldy very quickly.

- Prefer ``t.NamedTuple`` over ``collections.namedtuple``, because the former
  uses a more convenient ``class ...:`` syntax and also supports type
  annotations.
