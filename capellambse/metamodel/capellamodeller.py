    System engineering is an interdisciplinary approach encompassing the entire
    technical effort to evolve and verify an integrated and life-cycle balanced
    set of system people, product, and process solutions that satisfy customer
    needs.

    Systems engineering encompasses:

    - the technical efforts related to the development, manufacturing,
      verification, deployment, operations, support, disposal of, and user
      training for, systems products and processes;
    - the definition and management of the system configuration;
    - the translation of the system definition into work breakdown structures;
    - and development of information for management decision making.
