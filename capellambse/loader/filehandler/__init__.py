        A "file" in this context does not necessarily refer to a

        this method is not required to support random access.

        Parameters

            The name of the file, relative to the ``path`` that was

        During a transaction, writable objects returned by
        :meth:`open()` buffer their contents in a temporary location,
        and once the transaction ends, all updated files are committed
        to their destinations at once.  If the transaction is aborted,
        for example because an exception was raised, then all changes
        must be rolled back to the state immediately before the
        transaction.  If, during a transaction, any relevant file is
        touched without the file handler knowing about it, the behavior
        is undefined.

        Note that :meth:`open()` may refuse to open a file as writable
        if no transaction is currently open.  This depends on the needs
        of the underlying abstract file system.

        Transaction arguments
        ---------------------
        A concrete file handler implementation may accept arbitrary
        additional arguments to this method.  The implementation should
        however always support the case of no arguments given, in which
        case it should start a transaction with sensible defaults, and
        it should also accept and ignore any arguments it does not
        understand.  All additional arguments must be passed in via
        keywords.  Positional arguments are not supported.

        The return value of the context manager's ``__enter__()`` method
        is expected to be a mapping of all the keyword arguments that
        were not understood.  Client code may use this to react properly
        (e.g. by aborting the transaction early) if a required keyword
        argument is found to be not supported by the underlying file
        handler.  If a subclass wishes to call its super class'
        ``write_transaction()`` method, it should remove all the keyword
        arguments that it handles itself and pass on the others
        unchanged.

        Well-known arguments
        --------------------
        The following arguments are considered well-known, and their
        meaning is expected to be the same for all file handlers that
        support them.

        -   ``dry_run`` (``bool``): If set to ``True``, changes made
            during the transaction should be rolled back instead of
            being committed, just as if an exception had been raised.
        -   ``author_name`` (``str``): The name of the author of the
            changes.
        -   ``author_email`` (``str``): The e-mail address to record
            alongside the ``author_name``.
        -   ``commit_msg`` (``str``): A message describing the changes,
            which will be recorded in the version control system.
        -   ``remote_branch`` (``str``): If the model came from a remote
            version control system, changes are normally pushed back to
            the same branch on that remote.  This argument specifies an
            alternative branch name to push to (which may not yet exist
            on the remote).
